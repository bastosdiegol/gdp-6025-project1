# Configuration and Deployment Project #1: Write Test Cases

This solution was created using Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16 Toolset v142.

This Project utilizes the GoogleTest Library in order to simulate White and Black Box test cases.

The project is currently configured to be build in Debug and Release mode, both on x64 architecture.

You can run the this project through Visual Studio Solution or directly executing its .exe file making sure that BlackBoxTestLibrary.dll is within the same folder.

The tests results will be displayed on console.

Currently, the project needs no user inputs, since all Black and White Box tests cases arguments are static.
